**Description**

Web service about movies (and me). Here you can change the profile information and like/dislike the movie. Also you can search movie that you want by name or by length. This website can be accessed on any device from a mobile phone to a computer. To use the service, you must register and log in with your username and password. This is frontend part of full project. If you want to see backend part, you need to go to this [repositorie](https://github.com/pahanavr/movies-explorer-api).
